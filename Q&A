1.	Change settings to run web test on a certain iOS device in mobile cloud. Run test with your changes. Did test pass?
Yes, test passed
2.	Change settings to run native test on a certain/random Android device in mobile cloud.
Add support of appPackage and appActivity parameters for Android devices (reading from a .properties file and then
setting in the DesiredCapabilities). Locally installed Appium DT has no need in these parameters, but for Appium server
 of EPAM mobile cloud it’s mandatory.
Done
3.	 Run test with your changes. Did test pass?
Yes, test passed, but it is necessary to install manually ContactManager.apk on testing device on farm
4.	Try to use autoLaunch capability with app as before instead of appPackage and appActivity. Does this approach work?
No, test failed
5.	What’s wrong with our code? How to fix/improve it? Implement your suggestions.
